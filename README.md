# MultiLabel-Image-Tagging-with-Residual-Neural-Network-ResNet-18-CNN
This project implements a Multi-Label Image Tagging System using a Residual Neural Network (ResNet-18, CNN). The model is trained to classify images with multiple labels simultaneously, leveraging the power of deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
